# **Book of Princes**
The *Book of Princes* is presented to candidates before the selection ceremony. It contains portraits and personal notes from each eligible prince, intended to help noble families and candidates make informed strategic choices.  

- **Yin Zheng:** The only prince who intentionally refused to submit a portrait. His image only appears in the background of Songâ€™s submission.  
- **Song, Ang, Jun, Qi, Yan:** All submitted official portraits and brief personal statements highlighting their strengths or family alliances.
