# **Book Of Princes**
 - Prior to the Wife Selection, the Princes who are part of the selection submit portraits to the Book of Princes, along with any information they want potential wives to know. 
 -  Zheng is the only Prince to purposefully not submit a portrait. 
 -  Song, Ang, Jun, Qi, and Yan all submitted portraits and little tidbits of information. 
 -  Zheng is only visible due to being in the background of Song's portrait.
