| Ren Xinyue | Sun Shui    | Longstanding Colleagues | Mutual respect: Xinyue handles security, Sun Shui handles logistics. Xinyue finds Shui fussy; Shui finds Xinyue too stoic. | Comedic oil-and-water vibe, but extremely effective teamwork.                              |
| Ren Xinyue | Chenbi      | Protective Senior     | Xinyue quietly keeps an eye on Chenbi in dangerous palace spaces. Limited direct chatter.                         | Warm but understated; ‚Äúbig brother‚Äù watching the rookies.                                  |
| Ren Xinyue | Chenzi      | Protective Senior     | Similar to Chenbi‚Äîhe treats both twins with a watchful, quiet protectiveness.                                    | Stoic care; doesn‚Äôt say much, but they know he‚Äôs watching out for them.                     |
| Sun Shui   | Chenbi      | Mentor / Superior     | Sun Shui personally selected Chenbi; he trains and directs her closely to ensure Shenli will be supported properly. | Stern but fond; mentor‚Äìprot√©g√© dynamic with comedic fussing.                               |
| Sun Shui   | Chenzi      | Mentor / Superior     | Same as Chenbi‚ÄîChen twins are ‚Äúhis girls‚Äù to make sure the new mistress doesn‚Äôt get steamrolled by palace politics. | Warm, slightly exasperated dad energy; Chenzi teases him sometimes.                        |
| Chenbi     | Chenzi      | Twin Bond             | Deep mutual trust, practiced teamwork. They‚Äôve worked together long before Shenli arrived.                        | Playful, synchronized, sibling shorthand; ‚Äútwo halves of one competent brain.‚Äù             |
