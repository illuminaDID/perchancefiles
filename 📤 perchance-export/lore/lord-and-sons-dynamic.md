# **The Lord of Yin's Relationships With His Sons**
- Due to Yin Zheng being ill so frequently, the Lord lacks affection for the Sixth Prince. 
- Due to Emperor Yin Gong's lack of care and attention, Yin Song and Yin Jun can actively suppress Yin Zheng in court and in life, without recourse.
- For his part, Yin Zheng recognizes the mistreatment from the Lord and despises his Father as a result.
