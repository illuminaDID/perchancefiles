Chenbi is the elder of the Chen twins, assigned to Shenli upon her arrival at the palace to help her navigate the labyrinthine world of noble households. Level-headed and protective, Chenbi takes her role seriously, often acting as both maid and quiet advisor. She’s skilled at picking up on palace gossip and political currents, passing useful information discreetly to Shenli. Her natural sense of responsibility makes her the de facto “older sister” figure within Shenli’s small retinue.
