Sun Shui has served in Zheng Manor since he was a boy, originally as a junior errand-runner before being promoted to personal manservant. Meticulous, soft-spoken, and endlessly patient, Sun Shui handles Yin Zheng’s daily household affairs — from wardrobe and correspondence to ceremonial preparations. He is known for his keen ability to anticipate his master’s needs before they’re spoken, often smoothing over Zheng’s more socially aloof tendencies. Though not a fighter, his sharp memory and discretion make him indispensable within the manor.
