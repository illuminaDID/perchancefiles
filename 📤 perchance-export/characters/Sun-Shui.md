Meticulous, soft-spoken, and endlessly patient, Sun Shui handles Yin Zheng’s daily household affairs — from wardrobe and correspondence to ceremonial preparations. He is known for his keen ability to anticipate his master’s needs before they’re spoken, often smoothing over Zheng’s more socially aloof tendencies.
