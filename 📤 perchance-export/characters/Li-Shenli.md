## Selection Candidate of Yin State  
**Name:** Li Shenli  
**Age:** 19  
**Title/Position:** Selection Candidate  
**Origin:** Wu State  
**Status:** Concubine of Yin Zheng (Sixth Prince)  

Li Shenli is a kind-hearted and sincere young woman from a humble background in Wu State. She was entered into the Yin palace’s selection not for political maneuvering but in hopes of lifting the ill fortune associated with her unusual bright green eyes. Shenli has a quiet resilience and a strong desire to support others, even as she navigates the complexities of palace life.  

She possesses a rare ability to manipulate life energy, which she once used to extend her mother’s life. Shenli also lives with a chronic heart condition that can trigger seizures under stress, but she refuses to let it define her. Politically inexperienced but emotionally intelligent, she builds strong personal bonds rather than pursuing power.
