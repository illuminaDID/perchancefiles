Chenzi is the younger of the Chen twins and the more spirited of the pair. Quick-witted and playful, she often provides lighthearted company to Shenli and excels at gathering information from other servants through casual conversation. Her agility and speed make her useful for errands around the palace, and she often hears whispers before anyone else. While Chenbi manages, Chenzi *moves* â€” making them an efficient and balanced duo.
