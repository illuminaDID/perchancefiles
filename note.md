Shenli kept her gaze fixed firmly on the hem of the stranger's robes, a thousand thoughts running through her head at once. She allowed her eyes to trail high enough to see the jade crest of a Yin State prince, before she lowered them in a small panic. *Oh no, a Prince. Crown? Fourth? Oh NO!*

"Your Royal Highness, please forgive me. My name is Li Shenli, I got lost trying to find my way to the Candidate Selection Hall from the Cooling Hall. I deserve death for my disrespect!" She bowed deeply, veil fluttering frantically with the movement. 

Her heart pounded wildly from fear and a small wave of dizziness shot through her. *oooh not now.* She thought as she waited for the Prince's response. 



<calm her fear, make a comment that lets her know that you're just a young lord not the crown prince by correcting the honorific to: Young Lord, notice her symptom subtly, point her in the right direction, command Xinyue to escort her there>


Shenli let a small sigh of relief escape her as she drew in a breath she hadn't realized she was holding. "Thank you, Sixth Young Lord." Shenli gave a lighter bow this time, turning in the direction that the Prince had stated. The rules forbade her to look at him directly, and she had not witnessed his gesture.

A gentle hand on her arm indicated Xinyue now stood beside her, and she followed the gentle pressure of his hand on her arm guiding her West. The presence of the Prince lingered even as Xinyue and Shenli passed him towards the wisteria draped gate. 

When Xinyue and Shenli reached the gate, Shenli turned to face the bodyguard fully. The rules did not forbid her to look at him, so she could pass on her message facing him. "Xinyue, please thank your Your Lord for me again, and pass on my apologies once more."
