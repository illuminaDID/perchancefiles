# Imperial and Court Structure of Xin State

Xin State operates under a **centralized aristocratic monarchy**.  
The ruling family holds political, cultural, and symbolic primacy, while State administration is carried out through a hierarchy of princes, ministries, and court officials.

---

## üëë The Ruling House

- **Lord of Xin State** ‚Äî Patriarch of the ruling house.  
- **Principal Consorts** ‚Äî Senior wives and consorts, often mothers of princes; wield significant inner-court power.  
- **Princes / Young Lords** ‚Äî Male heirs ranked by birth order; assigned political, military, or bureaucratic roles.  
- **Princesses** ‚Äî Daughters are typically married off for political alliances.

---

## üß≠ Succession & Titles

- **The Heir** (Second Prince, Yin Song) is formally appointed and trained for eventual leadership.  
- Other princes receive titles and posts to prevent concentrated power but are expected to support the heir.  
- Succession disputes are typically fought through intrigue, alliances, and bureaucratic maneuvering rather than open war.

## üèõ Ministries and Bureaus

Xin State maintains several central ministries modeled on a classic bureaucratic system:

| Ministry                  | Overseen By     | Function |
|---------------------------|-----------------|----------|
| Ministry of Rites         | Fourth Prince (Yin Jun) | Rituals, ceremonies, imperial selection, marriages |
| Ministry of Household Registration | Second Prince (Yin Song) | Census, taxation, administration |
| Ministry of War / Defense | Senior Generals | Frontier security, Dan State relations |
| Ministry of Works         | Civil Bureaucrats | Infrastructure, canals, building |
| Ministry of Finance       | Appointed Ministers | Treasury, trade |
| Ministry of Justice       | Mixed Noble/Bureaucrat | Legal matters, court disputes |

---

## üèØ Inner Court vs Outer Court

- **Inner Court** = Imperial harem, consorts, princesses, eunuchs, palace staff.  
  - Overseen by the Empress Dowager and Principal Consorts.  
  - Political maneuvering here determines influence over princes and heirs.

- **Outer Court** = Ministries, military, civil bureaucracy.  
  - Primarily male-dominated, but female nobles influence through marriages and family alliances.

---

## ü™Ñ Selection Process

Every few years, Xin State hosts a **Selection** to bring eligible noblewomen from all nine States to the capital.  
These women are evaluated on:
- Etiquette
- Cultural refinement
- Education
- Political usefulness

Selected women are assigned as:
- **Primary Wives** (of princes)
- **Secondary Consorts**
- **Court Ladies**

This system reinforces Xin‚Äôs central power while binding other States through marriage.

|------------------|----------------|
| First Prince (Kun) | Military oversight, stationed in Mo |
| Second Prince (Song) | Heir apparent, bureaucratic leadership |
| Third Prince (An) | Married early, tied to Cang State politics |

## ‚ú® Notes

- Princes are **ranked by birth order**, but influence depends on **mother‚Äôs status, marriage alliances, and administrative roles**.  
- The **Inner Court politics** (consorts, princesses, eunuchs) often decide which princes rise or fall.  
- Ministry posts are *nominally* based on merit, but practically on political maneuvering.
