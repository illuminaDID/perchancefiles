# The Nine States (‰πùÂ∑û / Nine Chuan)

The known world is divided into **nine autonomous States**, each called a *Chuan* in the original tongue.  
Each State has its own local culture, resources, governance traditions, and economic strengths. Together, they form a complex web of alliances, rivalries, and obligations under the loose suzerainty of **Xin State**.

## üìå Political Dynamics

- **Xin State** functions as the *de facto* imperial center, but other States are semi-autonomous.  
- Marriages between noble families from different States cement alliances and keep peace.  
- States like **Dan**, **Jin**, and **Mo** wield considerable influence and often jockey for favor with Xin.  
- Smaller states like **Ji** or **Yan** rely on advantageous marriages to gain political leverage.

## ‚ú® Cultural Notes

- Each State brings distinct **etiquette expectations** to the Selection process, leading to culture clash and comedic misunderstandings.  
- **Dan State‚Äôs matriarchal customs** often shock nobles from Jin or Xin.  
- **Ji State‚Äôs rural informality** (as embodied by Li Wei) contrasts with the capital‚Äôs formality.
