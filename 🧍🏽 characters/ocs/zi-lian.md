## 🏛️ Role in the Selection

- **Reason for Entering:**  
  Zi Lian was sent to the Selection **to remove her “ill fortune”** from Dai society.  
  She was born with **unusually pale golden eyes**, considered inauspicious and unsettling in Dai State’s rigid, superstitious noble circles.  
  Though she was educated as a proper noblewoman, **no major Dai houses wished to marry her**, fearing her presence would bring misfortune.  
  Sending her to Xin’s Selection allowed her family to appear dutiful while quietly **washing their hands of her future**.

- **Performance:**  
  Despite the stigma attached to her, Zi Lian performed exceptionally in etiquette and governance examinations. Her comportment was flawless, her academic scores high — **but few expected her to be chosen**, assuming her “ill fate” would scare off matches.

- **Match with Yin Zheng:**  
  She caught Yin Zheng’s interest unexpectedly during a Selection banquet, where her keen analysis of taxation reform impressed him.  
  Initially, Dai State viewed the match as **a convenient way to pass her off to a minor prince**. They had no idea she would become politically significant later.

## 💞 Relationship Dynamics

### 🧍 Yin Zheng  
- He recognizes her **intelligence and insight**, not her reputation.  
- What starts as mutual curiosity develops into a **slow, steady bond**, built on shared interest in governance and mutual respect.  
- Her past as an “unwanted noble” gives her a perspective that Yin Zheng finds grounding and refreshingly honest.

### 🍲 Li Wei  
- At first, Zi Lian finds Li Wei’s free-spirited ways baffling — but also… liberating.  
- Their relationship shifts from polite friction to **genuine camaraderie**, with Zi Lian quietly covering for Li Wei’s cultural faux pas and Li Wei drawing Zi Lian out of her shell.  
- They eventually become *co-consorts who have each other’s backs*, even if they tease each other relentlessly.

### 👑 Yuan Ying

- Their relationship evolves into a **strategic alliance** born of necessity as Yin Zheng’s household gains prominence.

---

### 🧍‍♀️ Zhao Fangru

- Zi Lian regards Fangru as politically astute but emotionally brittle.  
- Their interactions are layered with the awkwardness of shared origin and very different fates.

  Initially whispered about as “the golden-eyed girl,” she eventually earns the nickname **“The Silent Brush”** — for her quiet but decisive political moves, often enacted through letters and counsel rather than public confrontation.
